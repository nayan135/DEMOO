Project Name: AmbuQuick – Rapid Response Ambulance App

Development Plan: Day 1

1. SOS Emergency Booking Button

One Touch Emergency Booking: The prime feature for any user to book an ambulance with just a single tap.
Automatic Location Detection: Integrate a basic geolocation feature (using GPS) to get the location of the user and automatically route it to the nearest ambulance or dispatch.
Ambulance ETA & Tracking: Show an estimated time of arrival for the ambulance and allow users to track it live.

2. Ambulance Selection [Basic Options]
a. Simple Ambulance Types: Emphasize no more than two, like Basic Life Support and Advanced Life Support, to make it simple.
b. Show ETA and Basic Cost Estimates: Display the estimated time and an approximate cost to the user for better clarity.

3. In-App Communication with EMTs
a. Basic In-App Call Feature: The user should be able to call the EMT or ambulance driver directly if needed.

4. Automated Notifications
SMS notifications at the time of booking confirmation are sent along with ETA to the user's phone. 
Live tracking link: A link shared with the patient's emergency contact/caretaker for tracking the location of the ambulance.

 Tech Stack

- Frontend: React Native (for fast, cross-platform mobile app development)
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js (for handling server logic quickly)
- Database: Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database (real-time capabilities for tracking and notifications)
- Location Services: Google Maps API or Mapbox (for live tracking and location detection)
- Communication: Twilio (for SMS notifications)

Day 1 Schedule

1. Morning: Frontend UI Setup
   - Design a simple, intuitive UI with key screens: Login/Profile Setup, SOS Booking Screen, Ambulance Tracking.

2. Afternoon: Backend Setup & Core API Integrations
   - Implement geolocation with Google Maps API.
   - Set up Firebase for real-time data (storing user location, ambulance location, and booking information).
   - Integrate Twilio for sending SMS notifications.

3. Evening: Connect Frontend and Backend
   - Link the SOS button to trigger backend functionality for booking, location sharing, and SMS notifications.
   - Start working on the ambulance ETA and live tracking feature.

 Day 2: Enhancements & Presentation Preparation
1. Enhanced Ambulance Tracking
   - Real-Time Updates: Improve the accuracy of live tracking with Firebase.
   - Ambulance ETA Updates: Display updated arrival times based on traffic and route changes.

2. Basic Driver & EMT Interface
